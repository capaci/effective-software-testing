# Effective software testing

Examples and exercices from the book "Effective Software Testing: A developer's guide", from Mauricio Aniche, written in Python.

In some cases, the examples are slightly different, since they were originally written in Java, and some practices change between the two languages.

But as Mauricio comments in the book, even though the languages are different, the same principles can be applied.
